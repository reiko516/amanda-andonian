===============

Personal website that I created as my final project for [General Assembly's](http://generalassemb.ly) 10-week "Front End Web Development" course.

Wireframes, design, and markup all done by yours truly. Files hosted on GitHub Pages over at [reiko516.github.io/amanda-andonian](http://reiko516.github.io/amanda-andonian).

Design Brief
============

I wanted to keep the site as simple as possible so that I didn't overextend myself, but I also wanted to showcase my sensibilities as a designer and developer.

The design itself is meant to reflect my history personality. At the top, a skyline of San Francisco's Outer Sunset (where I live) serves as the header. The background image is a PNG of a paper texture because I love to write. At first, I didn't have the main body enclosed by a white background, but I decided later that the page felt too floaty without it.
